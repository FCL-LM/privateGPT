> QUESTION:
What is Spring Boot, and how does it differ from traditional Spring framework?

> Answer (took 117.9 s.):
117.9
Spring Boot is an application development platform built on top of the Spring framework. It provides a convenient way to create standalone, production-ready applications that are ready to run out of the box. Unlike traditional Spring framework, which requires developers to manually configure and set up various components, Spring Boot takes care of many of these tasks automatically through its auto-configuration features. This allows developers to focus on writing their business logic without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Additionally, Spring Boot provides tools for building, testing, and running applications, making it a complete platform for developing modern web and microservices applications.

> QUESTION:
Explain the concept of "auto-configuration" in Spring Boot.

> Answer (took 98.81 s.):
98.81
 In Spring Boot, "auto-configuration" refers to the ability for Spring Boot to automatically configure and set up certain components based on certain conditions being met (such as the presence of specific Java classes or configurations). This helps developers speed up development time and reduce boilerplate code by allowing Spring Boot to handle common configuration tasks out of the box. Auto-configuration is implemented through the use of annotation processors that analyze the Java code and set up the necessary components based on certain conditions.

7.10. Creating Your Own Auto-configuration
If you work in a company that develops shared libraries, or if you work on an open-source or
commercial library, you might want to develop your own auto-configuration. Auto-configuration
classes can be bundled in external jars and still be picked up by Spring Boot.
Auto-configuration can be associated to a “starter” that provides the auto-configuration code as

11.7.1. Calling Web Services with WebServiceTemplate
If you need to call remote Web services from your application, you can use the WebServiceTemplate
class. Since WebServiceTemplate instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring
Boot does not provide any single auto-configured WebServiceTemplate bean. It does, however, auto-
configure a WebServiceTemplateBuilder, which can be used to create WebServiceTemplate instances
when needed.
The following code shows a typical example:

14.1. Deploying to the Cloud
Spring Boot’s executable jars are ready-made for most popular cloud PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
providers. These providers tend to require that you “bring your own container”. They manage
application processes (not Java applications specifically), so they need an intermediary layer that
adapts your application to the cloud’s notion of a running process.
Two popular cloud providers, Heroku and Cloud Foundry, employ a “buildpack” approach. The

Our primary goals are:
• Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring
development.
• Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge
from the defaults.
• Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as
embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).


> QUESTION:
What is Spring Boot's approach to testing and how can you write unit tests for your application?

> Answer (took 123.05 s.):
123.05
 Spring Boot provides a number of tools and annotations that make it easy to test your application. One way to write unit tests for your application is by using the @SpringBootTest annotation, which will create an ApplicationContext with Spring Boot features loaded. Alternatively, you can use the standard spring-test @ContextConfiguration annotation when you need Spring Boot features. The Spring Framework also includes a dedicated test module for such integration testing, which you can declare as a dependency directly or through the spring-boot-starter-test “Starter” to pull it in transitively. To write unit tests for your application, you should start by reading the relevant section of the Spring Framework reference documentation.

> QUESTION:
How can you integrate Spring Boot with different databases, such as MySQL or MongoDB?

> Answer (took 128.77 s.):
128.77
 To integrate Spring Boot with different databases, such as MySQL or MongoDB, you can use the provided integration libraries or create your own custom implementations. For example, for MySQL, you can use JDBC and Spring's Hibernate support to interact with the database. Similarly, for MongoDB, you can use Spring Data Mongo support to work with the NoSQL database. Additionally, Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Couchbase, LDAP and InfluxDB, but you must configure them yourself if you want to use any of these other databases.

Explain the concept of "profiles" in Spring Boot and how they can be used.

> Answer (took 112.77 s.):
112.77
 In Spring Boot, profiles are a way to define different configurations for your application based on certain conditions or requirements. You can create multiple profiles within your application's configuration file (e.g., application.properties), each with its own set of properties and settings. To activate a specific profile, you simply add the corresponding active flag in your application class or main method. Profiles are useful for situations where you need to configure your application differently depending on certain environmental factors or use cases.

the active Spring profiles. Profile sections are supported anywhere within the <configuration>
element. Use the name attribute to specify which profile accepts the configuration. The
<springProfile> tag can contain a profile name (for example staging) or a profile expression. A
profile expression allows for more complicated profile logic to be expressed, for example

> QUESTION:
What is the purpose of Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, and how can you use them?

> Answer (took 84.02 s.):
84.02
 Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are used to monitor and interact with your application. You can access these endpoints through HTTP requests, for example, using a web browser or an API client. Each endpoint provides information about a specific aspect of your application, such as health, cache usage, or bean definitions.

13.3. Monitoring and Management Over HTTP
If you are developing a web application, Spring Boot Actuator auto-configures all enabled
endpoints to be exposed over HTTP. The default convention is to use the id of the endpoint with a
prefix of /actuator as the URL path. For example, health is exposed as /actuator/health.
